/**
 * Contains a set of methods to schedule Zone runs.
 * Supposed to be used mostly in @MeteorReactive to patch
 * Meteor methods' callbacks.
 * After patching, callbacks will be run in the global zone
 * (i.e. outside of Angular 2), at the same time,
 * a Angular 2 zone run will be scheduled in order to
 * initiate UI update. In order to reduce number of
 * UI updates caused by the callbacks near the same time,
 * zone runs are debounced.
